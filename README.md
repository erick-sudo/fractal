# Fractal
 A fractal is a never-ending pattern.
 Fractals are infinitely complex patterms that are self-similar across different scales.
 They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.
 Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems - The pictures of Chaos.
